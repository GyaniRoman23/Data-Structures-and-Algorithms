## Introduction
**Hola Amigo!!**

I am Gyanesh and currently I am pursuing my _Bachelors_ in Electronics and Communications Engineering.

I do ___User Experience (UX) and Interface Designing (UI)___ and _Frontend Web Development_ as well. I have also done an internship at [Sudan's Tech](https://www.sudanstech.com/) where I was _Web User Interface_ Designer.
You can checkout some of my recent work [**ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰here**](https://romangdesign.netlify.app/).

My main motivation for joining this course on _Data Structures and Algorithms_ is that I wish to become a **Full-Stack Web Developer** and in order to do so I feel one of the most understated thing is emphasis on the need of Data Structures and Algorithms. They might not come into frequent use once we start working at some place but the problem solving skills which they help an individual build by giving them a bunch of tools is really wholesome. For someone new to it, it is basically a sort of Rubix Cube or say a chess game for certain people who are known as programmers and it has its own set of rules just like any other and uses its own unique platform(i.e. programming languages).
